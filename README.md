## How do you become an amazing software developer/engineer?

### 1. Programming Language - Fundamentally, the actual language doesn’t really matter. It’s simply a bunch of reserved keywords and structured syntax. 
Some language are better and some are bad. Learn as many as you can and be open minded. Learn the strengths of each language and understand their weaknesses. 
Don’t fall in love with a specific language and then refuse to look at other technologies because you’re sold on one. Learn to change and adapt. 

### 2. Frameworks - Frameworks is a ton more than an actual language. Being able to debug it, being able to instrument it. Being able to mutate it at run-time. 
The tools and libraries that come with it. Community support for it. Tutorials and training. Platforms that support it. Being able to do static and dynamic analysis.
All of these “things” around the language is MUCH more important than the language itself. For me, when choosing the next technology for that 5 year project … it
always comes down to this.
